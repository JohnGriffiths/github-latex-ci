			h2 How does this work?
			
			p
				| We run a LaTeX compiler in the cloud which listens for changes to your Github repository.
				| When you make a change, we compile the latest content and host the PDF and log files for
				| you to view at your leisure.
				
			p
				| You can embed a badge into your project's README or website so that you can see the latest
				| compile status and access the PDF with a single click.
				
			h2 Configuration options
			
			h3 Compiler
			
			p
				| You can set the LaTeX engine/compiler by including the following line in your LaTeX file:
				pre % !TEX program = lualatex
				| Valid values are <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>lualatex</code>, <code>xelatex</code>, and
				| <code>latex</code>.
				
			p
				| You can also specify this option in a <code>.latex.yml</code> file in your project:
				pre compiler: xelatex
				
			
			h3 Root file
			
			p
				| If your project contains multiple .tex files, we'll try to automatically detect which one to
				| run LaTeX on. However, if we get it wrong, you can specify it manually by including a 
				| <code>.latex.yml</code> file in your project with the following contents:
				pre root_file: thesis.tex
